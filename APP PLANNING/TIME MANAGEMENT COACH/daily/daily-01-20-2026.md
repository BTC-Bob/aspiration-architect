## Accomplishments

- Jenda completed Social Security appointment successfully (supports Homeownership Blueprint)
- Jenda completed Dr. Combs appointment (neck pain/stiffness evaluation)
- Jenda completed X-ray (same-day referral — efficient)
- **Strategic Planning Session:** Major clarity gained on business paths and personal infrastructure

### Planning Session Outcomes:

**Personal Infrastructure Apps (for life management, not revenue):**

| App | Status | Gaps Identified |
|-----|--------|-----------------|
| FinanceCommand | Live, 6 weeks old | Store dropdown incomplete, need Amazon Subscribe & Save tracking, need Homeownership dashboard |
| AspirationArchitect | 70-75% complete | Firestore save bug (blocking), Goals/tasks UX needs improvement |
| AI Coach | Keep in Claude | Await Claude Coworker for Windows — don't build into app |

**Business Paths (for revenue):**

| Business | Strategy | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| W4C Directory | Rebuild on Brilliant Directories → Organic SEO → AdSense | 25-year domain, previous peak $1,500/mo AdSense, currently $77/mo |
| TattooMosaic | Same approach — second Brilliant Directories slot | Concept stage, new domain |
| CNA Packet | Still primary Freedom Pillar engine | Needs full evaluation Wednesday |
| ARYVO | TBD | Deep-dive moved to Wednesday |

**Other Decisions:**
- Meal planning: Integrate into TMC as modular reference files (not separate project)
- W4C/TattooMosaic: Passive income path — organic only, no paid ads

---

## Carryover to Tomorrow (Wednesday)

**Priority — Strategic Evaluation Day:**
- Full business evaluation — all paths compared against March 2027 timeline
- ARYVO deep-dive
- Contact David re: website proposal (discuss)

**This Week:**
- Create meal planning reference files for TMC (Rob's preferences, Mom's needs, prostate-supportive foods)
- CNA Packet business model mapping
- Check for Claude Cowork Windows release (rollover)

---

## Notes

- Jenda's Dr. Combs visit was for neck pain and stiffness — X-ray completed same day
- W4C Directory: Had $1,500/month AdSense at peak — proves concept works with traffic
- Brilliant Directories lifetime deal = 2 directory slots (W4C + TattooMosaic)
- Meal planning must work for both Rob (prostate health) and Mom (84 years old)
- Eating window: 7 AM - 1 PM (6-hour window, 18-hour fast daily)
- David (client): Website proposal already sent by email — needs discussion
