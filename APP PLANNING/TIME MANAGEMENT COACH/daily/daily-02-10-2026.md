**Day:** Tuesday (Day off with Jenda)
**Energy Level:** — (no formal kickoff — deep build session all day)

## Foundation Inspection

*No formal kickoff today — went straight into ATLAS Framework build work*

## Today's Building Blocks

| # | Building Block | Type | Block | Status | Pillar/Blueprint |
|---|----------------|------|-------|--------|------------------|
| 1 | Verify life simulation implementation (Steps 0-5) | BA | AM | ✓ | Freedom: ATLAS Framework |
| 2 | Rewrite CLAUDE.md as lean router | BA | AM | ✓ | Freedom: ATLAS Framework |
| 3 | Create manifest.json (tool registry) | BA | AM | ✓ | Freedom: ATLAS Framework |
| 4 | Create daily-template.md + goals-template.md | BA | AM | ✓ | Freedom: ATLAS Framework |
| 5 | Remove empty scaffolding (blueprints/, weekly/) | BA | AM | ✓ | Freedom: ATLAS Framework |
| 6 | Root-level restructure — ATLAS as governance root | BA | PM | ✓ | Freedom: ATLAS Framework |
| 7 | Update 14 path references across 7 files | BA | PM | ✓ | Freedom: ATLAS Framework |
| 8 | Update MCP config + verify filesystem access | BA | PM | ✓ | Freedom: ATLAS Framework |
| 9 | Archive AlexWorkspace → retire legacy structure | BA | PM | ✓ | Freedom: ATLAS Framework |
| 10 | VS Code workspace test — Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md | BA | PM | ✓ | Freedom: ATLAS Framework |
| 11 | TMC daily log + retirement prep | BA | PM | ✓ | Freedom: ATLAS Framework |
| 12 | Water the plants | RO | — | ✗ | Foundation |
| 13 | Pick lemons | RO | — | ✗ | Foundation |

**Type Key:** `BA` = Blueprint-advancing | `FN` = Foundation | `RX` = Reactive | `TB` = Time-bound | `RO` = Rollover

## Accomplishments

*Completed building blocks and wins*

- **CLAUDE.md rewritten** — generic developer template replaced with custom lean router. Mode detection for 10 trigger patterns (coaching, building, life simulation, blended, closeout, filing, research, review, tool execution). Subagent awareness, three pillars integration, memory protocol, guardrails. 229 lines, zero filler.
- **Life simulation implementation verified** — all 5 steps from the Character Bible project confirmed complete. 4 life simulation files in /persona/, persona file updated to v1.1, decisions log current.
- **manifest.json created** — tool registry with all 6 memory scripts and build_app.md goal registered.
- **Templates completed** — daily-template.md (site journal format with Foundation Inspection) and goals-template.md (SOP template with pillar tagging).
- **Empty scaffolding removed** — blueprints/ and weekly/ deleted (were empty, never used).
- **ROOT-LEVEL RESTRUCTURE** — Biggest move of the day. ATLAS-FRAMEWORK promoted from peer project to governance root. New path: `C:\Users\mrxbi\ATLAS-FRAMEWORK\`. All 24 project folders moved into `/projects/`. CLAUDE.md at root means every Claude Code session reads it automatically. AlexWorkspace retired permanently.
- **14 path references updated** across CLAUDE.md, DECISIONS-LOG.md, and all 5 subagent files. Zero old references remaining.
- **MCP config updated** — Claude desktop app now points to new root. Verified with successful filesystem access.
- **AlexWorkspace archived and deleted** — legacy files saved to `projects/_archived-alex-workspace/`, old folder removed.
- **VS Code verified** — opened new workspace, Claude Code successfully read CLAUDE.md and identified GOTCHA + ATLAS + three pillars.
- **TMC project checked** — no broken paths (instructions are pure persona, no filesystem references). Running v1.0 persona (ATLAS has v1.1 with life simulation).

## Carryover to Tomorrow

- [ ] Water the plants (overdue — 4th day carried)
- [ ] Pick lemons (overdue since 02-09)
- [ ] First real coaching test in VS Code with ATLAS Framework

---

## Notes

- Tuesday — day off with Jenda
- This was the final build session for the ATLAS Framework initial setup phase
- The system is now operational: CLAUDE.md router → mode detection → subagents → persona → tools → memory
- TMC Claude Project can now be retired — all coaching moves to ATLAS Framework via VS Code or this Claude Project
- Decisions Log updated through Session 6 with root-level restructure entry
- 3 open questions resolved today: manifest schema, extra folders disposition, (root restructure added as new decision)
- Remaining open questions: which 3-5 life domains to activate, Telegram bot setup, voice model selection

## Construction Progress

| Pillar | Blueprint | Progress Made |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Freedom | ATLAS Framework | CLAUDE.md rewrite — system brain is now custom |
| Freedom | ATLAS Framework | Root restructure — governance wraps all projects |
| Freedom | ATLAS Framework | manifest.json + templates — operational infrastructure complete |
| Freedom | ATLAS Framework | VS Code verified — Claude Code reads the new router |
| Freedom | ATLAS Framework | Initial setup phase COMPLETE |

## Mindset Check

- **Target Slide completed today?** [ ] No — but the energy was pure flow
- **Today felt like:** [✓] Flow  [ ] Force  [ ] Mixed
- **Heart-mind alignment:** [✓] Aligned  [ ] Forcing  [ ] Unsure
- **Wrecking Balls encountered:** Locked .docx file (minor — OneDrive process). Quickly resolved.
- **What flowed?** Everything. The restructure went cleanly. Path updates were precise. VS Code test worked first try.
- **What felt forced?** Nothing. This was construction day at its best.
- **Tomorrow's first stone:** First real coaching kickoff in VS Code using the ATLAS Framework system.
