## Notes

*Observations, blockers, ideas, Wrecking Balls encountered*

- 14 days until eye surgery (02-17-2026)
- W4C Stripe tasks carried over for 3rd consecutive day — need dedicated Block 2 time
- W4C go-live target: by Friday 02-06-2026 (est. 8-12 hours remaining)
- Ally Bank application denied — identity verification, NOT credit. Existing Ally credit card ( limit,  balance) should help phone resolution. Call 877-247-2559.
- ATLAS Framework approved — implementation starts Thursday 02-05, five Block 2 sessions
- Recovery trend: 4 consecutive days under 50% (43, 43, 43, 35). Sleep quality fine. Worth monitoring.
- David: if no response by Tuesday, send text
- Meredith Clarke: Square billing still needs setup
- Rafael Pantoja: website needs updates
- Tomorrow (Tuesday 02-03): Jenda's Massage at 1:00 PM — Rob drives
