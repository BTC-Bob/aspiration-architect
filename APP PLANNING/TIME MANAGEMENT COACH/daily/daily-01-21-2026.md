## Accomplishments

### Major Strategic Planning Session Completed

**All six business paths evaluated against March 2027 homeownership timeline:**

| Path | Category | Decision |
|------|----------|----------|
| CNA Packet | Primary engine | Build weeks 2-7, launch sprint weeks 8-11 |
| W4C Directory | Passive income | **START FIRST** — 20 hours, then SEO builds passively |
| TattooMosaic | Phase 2 | After W4C proves model |
| ARYVO | Long-term (3-5 yrs) | Not for March 2027 timeline |
| ProstateProtocol | Long-term | Build for personal use, commercialize later |
| TransformingLocal | Opportunistic | Test with existing clients when time permits |

**Key Strategic Decision:** W4C first (start SEO clock), then CNA Packet.

**Rationale:** W4C needs 3-6 months for organic SEO traction. Starting it first means it builds passively while CNA Packet is in development. 20 focused hours gets W4C live, then CNA Packet gets 4-6 weeks of Block 2 focus.

### Other Work
- Received inquiry from existing client for AI Search SEO proposal
- Spent time preparing proposal (potential revenue)
