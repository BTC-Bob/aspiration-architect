## Freedom Pillar

### Blueprint: Homeownership

**Definition:**
Purchase a mobile home on owned land within 5 miles of Soboba Casino Resort by March 2027. Home for Rob, Jenda, Jenda's son Ajie (arriving April/May 2027 after college graduation), and Rob's mother (84, will contribute to expenses and co-sign mortgage).

**Why This Matters:**
Stability for Rob and Jenda. Freedom from renting. A home base for the expanding family. Foundation for financial peace.

**Target Date:** 03-31-2027

**Construction Stages:**

**Stage 1: Foundation (Debt & Credit)** — Target: 04-30-2026
- [ ] Jenda contacts HR about 401K loan process
- [ ] Execute 401K loan to pay off $7,500 credit card debt
- [ ] Verify Mom's credit score for co-sign
- [ ] Monitor credit score improvement after debt payoff

**Stage 2: Growth (Savings Acceleration)** — Target: 09-30-2026
- [ ] Maintain $1,000+/month savings rate
- [ ] Scale CNA Packet revenue toward target
- [ ] Jenda receives March 2026 raise (~$20/hr)
- [ ] Build emergency fund baseline

**Stage 3: Pre-Qualification** — Target: 12-31-2026
- [ ] Reach ~$19,500 in savings (3.5% FHA down payment + closing costs)
- [ ] Get pre-qualified for mortgage (Jenda primary, Mom co-sign)
- [ ] Begin property search

**Stage 4: Purchase & Close** — Target: 03-31-2027
- [ ] Find property (mobile home + land, ~$260K)
- [ ] Make offer and negotiate
- [ ] Complete mortgage process
- [ ] Close and move in

**Stage 5: Post-Move Optimization** — Target: 05-31-2027
- [ ] Ajie arrives from Philippines
- [ ] Jenda transitions to Slot Attendant (higher income with tips)
- [ ] Settle into new home

**Current Status:**
Stage 1 in progress. Comprehensive Master Plan created 01-18-2026. Key strategic decisions made: Jenda stays full-time until after closing, 401K loan (not withdrawal) for debt payoff, Mom will co-sign.

**Next Action:**
Jenda to contact Soboba HR about 401K loan process this week.

**Structural Challenges:**
- Rob's credit unusable (recent default) — Jenda is primary applicant
- Savings timeline tight — may need 3.5% FHA instead of 5% conventional
- Must maintain Jenda's full-time status for mortgage qualification

### Blueprint: CNA Packet Revenue

**Definition:**
CNA Packet generates $3,450/month gross revenue ($41,400/year), netting ~$2,330/month after taxes and business expenses. This closes the income gap needed for comfortable homeownership.

**Why This Matters:**
This is the engine that funds the Freedom Pillar. Without this revenue, the homeownership timeline is at risk.

**Target Date:** 01-31-2027

**Construction Stages:**

**Stage 1: Business Model Clarity** — Target: 01-31-2026
- [ ] Map out what CNA Packet sells (subscription membership for SNFs)
- [ ] Define pricing model ($49/month founders pricing)
- [ ] Calculate members needed (~71 members at $49/month)
- [ ] Document 30-day cold email workflow

**Stage 2: Revenue Ramp** — Target: 06-30-2026
- [ ] Reach $1,000/month revenue
- [ ] Refine outreach and conversion process
- [ ] Build case studies from early members

**Stage 3: Scale** — Target: 12-31-2026
- [ ] Reach $2,000/month revenue
- [ ] Systematize operations
- [ ] Reach $3,450/month revenue

**Current Status:**
Business exists. Expenses are $350/month. Revenue model and growth plan need to be mapped out.

**Next Action:**
Map out CNA Packet business model and revenue path in detail.

**Structural Challenges:**
- $350/month expenses must be covered before profit
- Need to validate cold email outreach effectiveness
- Time available for business development varies with other priorities

## Love Pillar

### Blueprint: Jenda's Debt Reduction & Credit Improvement

**Definition:**
Eliminate Jenda's $7,500 credit card debt and improve her credit score to strengthen mortgage qualification.

**Why This Matters:**
Jenda is the primary mortgage applicant. Her credit score directly impacts loan approval and interest rates. This also reduces monthly debt payments and stress.

**Target Date:** 04-30-2026

**Construction Stages:**

**Stage 1: 401K Loan Execution** — Target: 02-28-2026
- [ ] Jenda contacts Soboba HR about 401K loan process

- [ ] Receive loan funds
- [ ] Pay off credit card in full

**Stage 2: Credit Score Recovery** — Target: 04-30-2026
- [ ] Monitor credit score improvement (expect 30-50 point jump)
- [ ] Maintain zero balance on credit card
- [ ] Avoid new debt

**Current Status:**
Planning phase. Strategy decided (401K loan, not withdrawal). Need to initiate process with HR.

**Next Action:**
Jenda to contact Soboba HR about 401K loan process this week.

**Structural Challenges:**
- Must maintain full-time status to keep 401K loan terms
- Loan repayment comes from paycheck (~$200/month)

## Personal Projects

### Blueprint: AspirationArchitect

**Definition:**
Complete and launch AspirationArchitect.pro — a web app for goal achievement alignment and life journaling, built on React/Firebase.

**Why This Matters:**
This tool supports Rob's own construction process and could help others. It's also a demonstration of technical capability.

**Target Date:** TBD

**Construction Stages:**

**Stage 1: Core Completion** — Target: TBD
- [ ] Complete remaining 25% of app functionality
- [ ] Integrate AI Coach module (see aspiration-architect-coach-spec.md)
- [ ] Testing and polish

**Stage 2: Launch** — Target: TBD
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Begin using daily
- [ ] Gather feedback

**Current Status:**
Approximately 75% complete. AI Coach module spec created 01-18-2026.

**Next Action:**
Continue development when time permits. Blueprint work on Freedom Pillar takes priority.

**Structural Challenges:**
- Competes for Block 2 time with CNA Packet work
- AI integration requires Claude API (cost considerations)
