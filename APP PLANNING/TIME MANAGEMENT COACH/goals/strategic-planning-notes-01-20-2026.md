### 6. TransformingLocal.com

## Personal Infrastructure Apps (Not Revenue — Life Management)

| AspirationArchitect | Goals, daily logs, life tracking | 70-75% | Firestore save bug (blocking), Goals/tasks UX |

**Decision made:** These support life operations, not revenue generation. Fix gaps as maintenance, don't prioritize over income-generating work.
