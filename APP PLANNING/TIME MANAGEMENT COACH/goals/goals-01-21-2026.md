**Building Block Types:** Blueprint-advancing | Foundation | Reactive | Time-bound | Rollover

**Transurfing Reminders:**
- *The completed structure already exists. You are selecting it and walking toward it.*

## Freedom Pillar

### Blueprint: Homeownership

**Definition:**
Purchase a mobile home on owned land within 5 miles of Soboba Casino Resort by March 2027. Home for Rob, Jenda, Jenda's son Ajie (arriving April/May 2027 after college graduation), and Rob's mother (84, will contribute to expenses and co-sign mortgage).

**Why This Matters:**
Stability for Rob and Jenda. Freedom from renting. A home base for the expanding family. Foundation for financial peace.

**Target Date:** 03-31-2027

**Construction Stages:**

**Stage 1: Foundation (Debt & Credit)** — Target: 04-30-2026
- [ ] Jenda contacts HR about 401K loan process
- [ ] Execute 401K loan to pay off $7,500 credit card debt
- [ ] Verify Mom's credit score for co-sign
- [ ] Monitor credit score improvement after debt payoff

**Stage 2: Growth (Savings Acceleration)** — Target: 09-30-2026
- [ ] Maintain $1,000+/month savings rate
- [ ] Scale CNA Packet revenue toward target
- [ ] Jenda receives March 2026 raise (~$20/hr)
- [ ] Build emergency fund baseline

**Stage 3: Pre-Qualification** — Target: 12-31-2026
- [ ] Reach ~$19,500 in savings (3.5% FHA down payment + closing costs)
- [ ] Get pre-qualified for mortgage (Jenda primary, Mom co-sign)
- [ ] Begin property search

**Stage 4: Purchase & Close** — Target: 03-31-2027
- [ ] Find property (mobile home + land, ~$260K)
- [ ] Make offer and negotiate
- [ ] Complete mortgage process
- [ ] Close and move in

**Stage 5: Post-Move Optimization** — Target: 05-31-2027
- [ ] Ajie arrives from Philippines
- [ ] Jenda transitions to Slot Attendant (higher income with tips)
- [ ] Settle into new home

**Current Status:**
Stage 1 in progress. Strategic business evaluation completed 01-21-2026. Two revenue engines identified: W4C Directory (passive) and CNA Packet (primary). Sequencing decided: W4C first to start SEO clock.

**Next Action:**
Complete W4C Directory rebuild (20 hours) by 01-25-2026.

**Structural Challenges:**
- Rob's credit unusable (recent default) — Jenda is primary applicant
- Savings timeline tight — may need 3.5% FHA instead of 5% conventional
- Must maintain Jenda's full-time status for mortgage qualification

### Blueprint: W4C Directory Revenue (NEW — PRIMARY SEQUENCE POSITION)

**Definition:**
Rebuild Websites4Contractors.com on Brilliant Directories platform. Generate passive income through AdSense and premium listings via organic SEO.

**Why This Matters:**
W4C has a 25-year domain with proven earning history ($1,500/month AdSense at peak). Starting first allows SEO to build passively while CNA Packet is developed. Low maintenance once live.

**Target Date:** 01-25-2026 (Go-Live) / 07-2026 (Meaningful Traffic)

**The Completed Vision (Target Slide):**
W4C is live, indexing on Google, and generating $500+/month in AdSense revenue. SEO agencies are sending contractor clients for premium listings. The site runs passively with 1-2 hours/week maintenance.

**Construction Stages:**

**Stage 1: Rebuild** — Target: 01-25-2026
- [ ] Log into Brilliant Directories, explore platform
- [ ] Connect domain, select theme
- [ ] Configure categories and listing structure
- [ ] Set up payment gateway (Stripe)
- [ ] Migrate/create core content
- [ ] Configure SEO settings
- [ ] Go live

**Stage 2: Outreach** — Target: 02-15-2026
- [ ] Create SEO agency outreach email template
- [ ] Build outreach list (50+ agencies)
- [ ] Begin email campaign
- [ ] Track responses and conversions

**Stage 3: Optimization** — Target: 06-30-2026
- [ ] Monitor traffic and rankings
- [ ] Optimize based on search console data
- [ ] Add content as needed
- [ ] Refine premium listing offers

**Current Status:**
Brilliant Directories account exists. Platform not accessed in long time. Rebuild scheduled for this week (01-21 to 01-25).

**Next Action:**
Thursday 01-22: Log into Brilliant Directories, begin reorientation.

**Structural Challenges:**
- Learning curve on Brilliant Directories platform
- SEO takes 3-6 months to gain traction
- Need content strategy for contractor categories

**Revenue Targets:**
- Conservative (12 months): $300-500/month
- Optimistic: $1,000+/month

**Maintenance (Post-Launch):** 1-2 hours/week

### Blueprint: CNA Packet Revenue

**Definition:**
CNA Packet generates $3,450/month gross revenue ($41,400/year), netting ~$2,330/month after taxes and business expenses. This closes the income gap needed for comfortable homeownership.

**Why This Matters:**
This is the engine that funds the Freedom Pillar. Only path that can close the full income gap. Without this revenue, the homeownership timeline is at risk.

**Target Date:** 01-31-2027

**The Completed Vision (Target Slide):**
71 California SNFs are paying $49/month for CNA Packet membership. The interactive workflow app guides them through packet assembly. Automated email sequences bring in new members. Revenue is $3,450/month gross.

**Construction Stages:**

**Stage 1: App Development** — Target: 03-07-2026
- [ ] Define v1 scope (CA only, single active packet, desktop first)
- [ ] Build welcome + resume flow
- [ ] Implement packet state machine (Locked/In Progress/Deferred/Complete)
- [ ] Create live packet preview (HTML)
- [ ] Build 3-5 core sections
- [ ] Implement one-click PDF export
- [ ] Error handling and polish

**Stage 2: Launch Preparation** — Target: 03-14-2026
- [ ] Build CA SNF lead list (Tier A: multi-facility, Tier B: single)
- [ ] Create landing page (promise + offer + proof + FAQ)
- [ ] Set up Stripe subscription checkout
- [ ] Create cold email sequence (12 touches over 30 days)
- [ ] Create nurture sequence (5-7 emails over 10 days)

**Stage 3: Acquisition Sprint** — Target: 04-15-2026
- [ ] Launch 30-day cold email campaign
- [ ] Monitor deliverability and conversions
- [ ] Iterate subject lines and copy
- [ ] Optimize landing page based on feedback

**Stage 4: Scale** — Target: 12-31-2026
- [ ] Reach $1,000/month revenue
- [ ] Refine outreach and conversion process
- [ ] Build case studies from early members
- [ ] Reach $2,000/month revenue
- [ ] Reach $3,450/month revenue

**Current Status:**
Website 92% complete. App not started. Full scope defined 01-21-2026: interactive workflow app that builds and exports submission packet. Build begins after W4C goes live (~01-26-2026).

**Next Action:**
Complete W4C first, then begin CNA Packet app development.

**Structural Challenges:**
- $19/month expenses must be covered before profit
- App development requires 4-6 weeks (20-24 hrs/week)
- Need to validate cold email outreach effectiveness

**App Definition (v1):**
- Interactive workflow + packet builder
- Guided step-by-step path (CA state-aware)
- Section states: Locked / In Progress / Deferred / Complete
- Live packet preview with placeholders
- One-click PDF export (draft anytime, final when complete)
- Feedback capture (lightweight)

**NOT:** Template download library, multi-packet manager, document editor, multi-state rules engine

**Build Timeline:**
- Internal alpha: 7-10 focused days
- Private beta: 2-3 weeks
- v1.0 subscriber-worthy: 4-6 weeks

**Maintenance (Post-Launch):** 3-5 hours/week

## Health Pillar

### Blueprint: Eye Surgery

**Definition:**
Successfully complete eye surgery to address current vision issues.

**Why This Matters:**
Clear vision supports all other construction. Health is foundational.

**Target Date:** TBD (after consultation)

**Construction Stages:**

**Stage 1: Consultation** — Target: 01-28-2026
- [ ] Attend eye surgeon consultation (01-28-2026)
- [ ] Understand diagnosis and options
- [ ] Schedule surgery if recommended

**Stage 2: Surgery & Recovery** — Target: TBD
- [ ] Complete surgery

- [ ] Follow-up appointments

**Current Status:**
Consultation scheduled for 01-28-2026.

**Next Action:**
Attend consultation on 01-28-2026.

**Structural Challenges:**
- Recovery will require temporary shift to maintenance-only mode
- May need to limit screen time during recovery

---

### Blueprint: Prostate Monitoring

**Definition:**
Address prostate concerns with new urologist. Rule out or address any cancer concerns.

**Why This Matters:**
Health uncertainty creates mental drag on all construction. Clarity enables focus.

**Target Date:** TBD (after consultation)

- [ ] Adjust daily expectations during any treatment/recovery

**Current Status:**
Consultation scheduled for 03-10-2026. ProstateProtocol app concept evaluated — build for personal use, potential commercialization later.

**Next Action:**
Attend consultation on 03-10-2026. Continue prostate health stack (Pumpkin Seed Oil, Vitality Nexus Elixir, fasting).

**Structural Challenges:**
- Uncertainty until diagnosis is known
- Possible treatment could impact construction capacity

## Love Pillar

### Blueprint: Jenda's Debt Reduction & Credit Improvement

**Definition:**
Eliminate Jenda's $7,500 credit card debt and improve her credit score to strengthen mortgage qualification.

**Why This Matters:**
Jenda is the primary mortgage applicant. Her credit score directly impacts loan approval and interest rates. This also reduces monthly debt payments and stress.

**Target Date:** 04-30-2026

**Construction Stages:**

**Stage 1: 401K Loan Execution** — Target: 02-28-2026
- [ ] Jenda contacts Soboba HR about 401K loan process
- [ ] Complete 401K loan paperwork
- [ ] Receive loan funds
- [ ] Pay off credit card in full

**Stage 2: Credit Score Recovery** — Target: 04-30-2026
- [ ] Monitor credit score improvement (expect 30-50 point jump)
- [ ] Maintain zero balance on credit card
- [ ] Avoid new debt

**Current Status:**
Planning phase. Strategy decided (401K loan, not withdrawal). Need to initiate process with HR.

**Next Action:**
Jenda to contact Soboba HR about 401K loan process this week.

**Structural Challenges:**
- Must maintain full-time status to keep 401K loan terms
- Loan repayment comes from paycheck (~$200/month)

## Personal Projects

### Blueprint: AspirationArchitect

**Definition:**
Complete and launch AspirationArchitect.pro — a web app for goal achievement alignment and life journaling, built on React/Firebase.

**Why This Matters:**
This tool supports Rob's own construction process and could help others. It's also a demonstration of technical capability.

**Target Date:** TBD (after income stable)

**Current Status:**
Approximately 70-75% complete. Firestore save bug blocking progress. AI Coach module spec created 01-18-2026.

**Decision (01-21-2026):** This is personal infrastructure, not revenue. Fix gaps as maintenance. Don't prioritize over income-generating work. Keep AI Coach in Claude — await Claude Coworker for Windows.

**Next Action:**
Continue development when time permits. Freedom Pillar revenue work takes priority.

**Gaps Identified:**
- Firestore save bug (blocking)
- Goals/tasks UX needs improvement

## Long-Term Blueprints (Post March 2027)

### ARYVO (3-5 Year Timeline)

**Concept:** Personal thought-capture and insight engine with eventual social matching based on thought patterns.

**Status:** Concept only. Brand foundation locked (name, domain, tagline, visual identity).

**Why Later:** Social products require critical mass. Layer 3 (matchmaking) drives subscription value but needs years of user data.

---

### ProstateProtocol (After Income Stable)

**Concept:** App for prostate health management — sleep, autophagy, diet optimization.

**Status:** Concept only. Market research confirms opportunity (only 20 prostate apps exist out of 300,000 medical apps).

**Why Later:** Build for personal use now (proof of concept). Commercialize after March 2027.

---

### TattooMosaic (After W4C Stable)

**Concept:** Tattoo artist directory using Brilliant Directories (second slot on lifetime deal).

**Status:** Concept only. Competition exists but market is large ($16B industry).

**Why Later:** Zero domain authority. Same model as W4C — copy-paste execution once W4C proves concept.

---

### TransformingLocal (Opportunistic)

**Concept:** AI phone agents and Google Review automation for local service providers.

**Status:** Concept only.

**Why Later:** Service-heavy model conflicts with preference for minimal direct client interaction. Test with existing clients when time permits.
