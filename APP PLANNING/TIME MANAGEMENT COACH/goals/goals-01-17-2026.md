## Priority 1: Financial Freedom (Zero Money Stress)

### Definition
Household income supports comfortable homeownership near San Jacinto, CA (within 5 miles of Soboba Casino Resort) without frequent financial anxiety or checking accounts obsessively. FinanceCommand.pro manages spending wisely while CNA Packet generates supplemental income.

### Why This Matters
Stability for Rob and Jenda. Ability to buy a home—specifically a new mobile home on owned land. Freedom from money stress and the mental load of constantly monitoring finances.

### Target Date
January 2027 (12 months)

### The Plan

**Phase 1: Foundation** — Target: TBD
- [ ] Define CNA Packet business model and revenue path
- [ ] Establish FinanceCommand.pro as daily money management system
- [ ] Build emergency fund baseline

**Phase 2: Growth** — Target: TBD
- [ ] Scale CNA Packet to $1,000/month revenue
- [ ] Scale CNA Packet to $2,000/month revenue
- [ ] Begin saving for down payment

**Phase 3: Home Purchase** — Target: TBD
- [ ] Reach $3,450/month CNA Packet revenue
- [ ] Secure financing for mobile home + land (~$260K)
- [ ] Purchase home

### Current Status
Initial planning. Established target numbers:
- Target household income: $85,000/year gross (for mortgage qualification)
- Target net monthly income: $6,420 (for comfortable living)
- Current net income: $4,090/month
- Gap to fill: $2,330/month net → $3,100/month gross personal income from CNA Packet

### Next Action
Define CNA Packet business model and map revenue path to $3,450/month

### Obstacles & Considerations
- CNA Packet business expenses: $350/month (must be covered before profit)
- TurboTax payment issue for Sarah (recurring billing problem)
- Existing debt payments: $800/month
- Jenda's income is stable but fixed at $19.50/hour
