# Strategic Evaluation: Business Paths vs March 2027 Timeline

*Completed: 01-21-2026*
*Goal: Close income gap for Homeownership Blueprint*
*Deadline: March 2027 (14 months)*
*Gap to fill: ~$3,450/month gross revenue*

---

## Executive Summary

Six business paths were evaluated. Two are prioritized for the 14-month timeline. Three are categorized as long-term opportunities. One is opportunistic/low priority.

**Recommended Sequence:**
1. **W4C Directory** — Start first (20 hours), let SEO build passively
2. **CNA Packet** — Primary revenue engine, 4-6 weeks to v1.0

**By Summer 2026:** Both revenue streams active—CNA Packet scaling through outreach, W4C building through organic traffic.

## Path 1: CNA Packet (CNAPacket.com)

### Status
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Current Revenue | $0 |
| Current Expenses | $19/month |
| Website | 92% complete |
| App | Not started |
| Target Revenue | $3,450/month (71 members @ $49/month) |

### What It Is
CNA Packet is "the shortest path from zero to a state-ready CNA program packet" for California SNFs.

**Core Value ($49/month membership):**
1. Ready-to-use CA document templates matching CDPH NATP expectations
2. Source-backed formatting and QA conventions
3. Living "current best version" as templates improve over time
4. Step-by-step classroom process to assemble the packet

### App Requirements (v1)
- **Interactive workflow app** that builds and exports a submission packet
- Guided workflow with section states (Locked / In Progress / Deferred / Complete)
- Live packet preview that updates as sections complete
- One-click PDF export (draft anytime, final when complete)
- Feedback capture (lightweight)

**NOT:** Template download library, multi-packet manager, full document editor, multi-state rules engine

### Build Timeline
| Phase | Duration | Outcome |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Internal alpha | 7-10 focused days | Welcome + resume, packet state machine, live preview, 1-2 sections |
| Private beta | 2-3 weeks | 3-5 sections, polished preview, draft export |
| v1.0 subscriber-worthy | 4-6 weeks | Full section set, professional PDF export, error handling |

**Available time:** 20-24 hours/week
**Realistic v1.0:** 4-6 weeks

### Acquisition Strategy
- 30-day cold email workflow targeting CA SNF decision makers
- Self-serve subscription checkout (Stripe)
- Automated onboarding sequence
- Tier A targets: Multi-facility operators (one decision = multiple facilities)
- Tier B targets: Single facility SNFs

### Revenue Timeline
- **Weeks 1-6:** App development
- **Week 7:** Launch + acquisition sprint begins
- **Weeks 8-11:** Sprint optimization
- **First meaningful revenue:** ~10 weeks from start

### Maintenance (Post-Launch)
- 3-5 hours/week
- Email sequence optimization
- Landing page tweaks
- Template updates for ongoing membership value

### Verdict
✓ **Primary revenue engine.** Only path that can close the full $3,450/month gap. Automated acquisition minimizes direct client interaction. Build after W4C is live.

## Path 2: W4C Directory (Websites4Contractors.com)

### Status
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Current Revenue | $77/month |
| Current Expenses | $53/month |
| Net | ~$24/month |
| Domain Age | 25 years |
| Previous Peak | $1,500/month AdSense |
| Current State | Stagnant, dated design |

### Strategy
- Rebuild on Brilliant Directories platform (lifetime deal owned)
- Organic SEO only — no paid advertising
- Revenue via AdSense + premium listings
- SEO agency outreach for B2B listing sales

### Build Timeline
- **20 focused hours** to launch-ready
- Brilliant Directories handles heavy lifting (no custom code)
- Work includes: content migration, category structure, SEO optimization, design polish

### Revenue Timeline
- **Conservative (12 months):** $300-500/month
- **Optimistic (if traffic recovers):** $1,000+/month
- **SEO traction begins:** 3-6 months after launch

### Maintenance (Post-Launch)
- 1-2 hours/week
- Content/listing moderation
- Minor SEO adjustments

### Why Start First
The SEO clock is the constraint. W4C needs 3-6 months to gain organic traction. Starting it first means it's building passively while CNA Packet is in development. Starting it second wastes those months.

### Verdict
✓ **Start first.** 20 hours gets it live, then it builds passively. Proven model (previous $1,500/month peak). 25-year domain authority is a significant asset.

## Path 3: TattooMosaic (TattooMosaic.com)

### Status
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Current Revenue | $0 |
| Current Expenses | $1.67/month |
| Domain Age | New (no authority) |
| Concept | Tattoo artist directory + premium listings |
| Platform | Brilliant Directories (second slot on lifetime deal) |

### Market Research
- Competition exists: TattoosWizard, Tattoodo, TattooCloud, LocalTattoos, Inkppl, Booksy
- US tattoo industry: $16 billion
- 32% of American adults have at least one tattoo
- Potential differentiator: AI-generated tattoo designs

### Revenue Streams
| Stream | Model |
|--------|-------|
| Premium listings | $10-50/month per artist |
| AdSense | Traffic-dependent |
| Lead gen fees | Per booking/connection |
| AI tattoo designs | Per-design sales |

### Timeline Concern
Starting from zero domain authority. Organic SEO could take 12-18 months to gain meaningful traction.

### Verdict
⏸ **Phase 2 project.** Build after W4C proves model. Same approach, copy-paste execution once W4C is generating. Not viable for March 2027 timeline.

## Path 4: ARYVO (aryvo.ai)

### Status
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Current Revenue | $0 |
| Current Expenses | $15/month |
| Stage | Concept only |
| Revenue Model | Subscription (eventual) |
| Target Users | Initially creatives/entrepreneurs, eventually everyone |

### What It Is
Personal thought-capture and insight engine:
- **Layer 1 — Capture:** Voice + text input for ideas, tasks, moments
- **Layer 2 — Clarity:** AI-powered auto-organization, pattern recognition, surfacing insights
- **Layer 3 — Connection (future):** Match users with like-minded people based on thought patterns

### Brand Foundation (Locked)
- Name: Aryvo
- Domain: aryvo.ai
- Tagline: Capture. Clarify. Connect.
- Mantra: Capture the spark. Let insight appear. Follow the thread.
- Logo: Three intersecting circles
- Tone: Calm clarity
- Philosophy: Reality Transurfing (background influence)

### Timeline Reality
Layer 3 (matchmaking that drives subscription value) requires critical mass of users generating thought data. Social products are notoriously slow to monetize.

**Realistic timeline:** 3-5 years to meaningful revenue.

### Verdict
⏸ **Long-term Blueprint.** Compelling vision, but not a March 2027 solution. Keep developing the concept. Build when income is stable.

## Path 5: ProstateProtocol (ProstateProtocol.com)

### Status
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Current Revenue | $0 |
| Current Expenses | $1.68/month |
| Concept | App for prostate health management — sleep, autophagy, diet optimization |
| Personal Need | Yes — urologist consultation 03-10-2026 |

### Market Research
| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Global prostate health market | $36.5B (2024) → $91.9B by 2034 |
| CAGR | 9.8% |
| BPH prevalence at age 60 | 50% |
| BPH prevalence at age 90 | 90% |
| Prostate-related apps in app stores | Only 20 out of 300,000 medical apps |
| Online/telemedicine channel growth | 11.23% CAGR (fastest growing) |

### Opportunity
Research notes "the potential in the field of Urology is still underused." Privacy-conscious men want convenient home-based monitoring. Lifestyle optimization (sleep, autophagy, diet) appears differentiated from existing apps that focus on symptom tracking.

### Verdict
⏸ **Long-term project.** Real commercial potential confirmed by research. Build for personal use now (proof of concept). Commercialize after March 2027.

## Path 6: TransformingLocal (TransformingLocal.com)

### Status
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Current Revenue | $0 |
| Current Expenses | $1.68/month |
| Concept | AI phone agents, Google Review automation for local service providers |
| Stage | Concept only |

### Fit Assessment
AI phone agents would likely require client setup, customization, and ongoing support—more direct interaction than directory or subscription products.

**Filter applied:** "Develop systems that don't require me to deal with people as directly."

TransformingLocal is more service-heavy than preferred model.

### Verdict
⏸ **Low priority. Opportunistic testing only.** Existing local clients could be test cases when time permits. Not a primary income path.

---

## Personal Infrastructure Apps (Not Revenue)

These support life operations, not revenue generation. Fix gaps as maintenance, don't prioritize over income-generating work.

| App | Purpose | Status | Gaps |
|-----|---------|--------|------|
| FinanceCommand.pro | Money management | Live, 6 weeks | Store dropdown, Subscribe & Save, Homeownership dashboard |
| AspirationArchitect | Goals, daily logs | 70-75% | Firestore save bug (blocking), Goals/tasks UX |

**AI Coach:** Keep in Claude. Await Claude Coworker for Windows — don't build into app.

---

## Key Assets

| Asset | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Brilliant Directories lifetime deal | 2 directory slots (W4C + TattooMosaic) |
| W4C 25-year domain | Established SEO authority (dormant but recoverable) |
| TMC Claude Project | Working coaching system |
| React/Firebase skills | Can build apps without outsourcing |
| Construction trades knowledge | Relevant to W4C, TransformingLocal |

---

## Constraints

- Rob works Wed-Sun (construction schedule)
- Mon-Tue are days off with Jenda — lighter work
- Block 2 (8:00-11:20 AM) is sacred for deep work
- 20-24 hours/week available for development
- March 2027 deadline is firm (Homeownership)
- Prefer passive income models where possible
- No budget for paid advertising
- Minimize direct client interaction

---

## Final Sequence

| Weeks | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| 1 | W4C rebuild (20 focused hours) |
| 2 | W4C goes live + SEO agency outreach campaign begins |
| 2-7 | CNA Packet v1 build (Block 2 focus) |
| 8-11 | CNA Packet acquisition sprint |
| Ongoing | W4C gaining traction passively in background |

**By mid-March:** CNA Packet could have first paying members.
**By mid-April:** W4C is live and indexing.
**By summer:** Both revenue streams active.

---

## Ongoing Maintenance (Post-Launch)

| Path | Weekly Time | Nature |
|------|-------------|--------|
| CNA Packet | 3-5 hours | Email sequence tweaks, landing page optimization, template updates |
| W4C Directory | 1-2 hours | Content/listing moderation, minor SEO adjustments |

**Total maintenance:** 4-7 hours/week once both are running.

---

## Decision Summary

| Path | Priority | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| W4C Directory | 1 | Start this week |
| CNA Packet | 2 | Start week 2, primary Block 2 focus |
| TattooMosaic | — | After W4C stable |
| ARYVO | — | Long-term (3-5 years) |
| ProstateProtocol | — | Personal use now, commercialize later |
| TransformingLocal | — | Opportunistic testing only |
