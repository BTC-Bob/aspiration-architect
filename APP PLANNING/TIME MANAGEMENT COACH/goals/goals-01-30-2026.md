**Building Block Types:** Blueprint-advancing | Foundation | Reactive | Time-bound | Rollover

**Transurfing Reminders:**
- *The completed structure already exists. You are selecting it and walking toward it.*
- *Grip loosely. Over-Engineering creates resistance.*
- *Watch for Wrecking Balls — external forces pulling energy from your Blueprints.*
- *Heart-mind aligned? If not, pause and listen deeper.*

## Freedom Pillar

### Blueprint: Homeownership

**Definition:**
Purchase a mobile home on owned land within 5 miles of Soboba Casino Resort by March 2027. Home for Rob, Jenda, Jenda's son Ajie (arriving April/May 2027 after college graduation), and Rob's mother (84, will contribute to expenses and co-sign mortgage).

**Why This Matters:**
Stability for Rob and Jenda. Freedom from renting. A home base for the expanding family. Foundation for financial peace.

**Target Date:** 03-31-2027

**Construction Stages:**

**Stage 1: Foundation (Debt & Credit)** — Target: 04-30-2026
- [ ] Jenda contacts HR about 401K loan process
- [ ] Execute 401K loan to pay off $7,500 credit card debt
- [ ] Verify Mom's credit score for co-sign
- [ ] Monitor credit score improvement after debt payoff

**Stage 2: Growth (Savings Acceleration)** — Target: 09-30-2026
- [ ] Maintain $1,000+/month savings rate
- [ ] Scale CNA Packet revenue toward target
- [ ] Jenda receives March 2026 raise (~$20/hr)
- [ ] Build emergency fund baseline

**Stage 3: Pre-Qualification** — Target: 12-31-2026
- [ ] Reach ~$19,500 in savings (3.5% FHA down payment + closing costs)
- [ ] Get pre-qualified for mortgage (Jenda primary, Mom co-sign)
- [ ] Begin property search

**Stage 4: Purchase & Close** — Target: 03-31-2027
- [ ] Find property (mobile home + land, ~$260K)
- [ ] Make offer and negotiate
- [ ] Complete mortgage process
- [ ] Close and move in

**Stage 5: Post-Move Optimization** — Target: 05-31-2027
- [ ] Ajie arrives from Philippines
- [ ] Jenda transitions to Slot Attendant (higher income with tips)
- [ ] Settle into new home

**Current Status:**
Stage 1 in progress. Strategic business evaluation completed 01-21-2026. Two revenue engines identified: W4C Directory (passive) and CNA Packet (primary). W4C rebuild 70% complete — go-live target 01-31-2026. Client revenue secured: Wade ($1,050, Phase 1 complete) and David ($75-100).

**Next Action:**
Complete W4C Directory rebuild and go live (01-31-2026).

**Structural Challenges:**
- Rob's credit unusable (recent default) — Jenda is primary applicant
- Savings timeline tight — may need 3.5% FHA instead of 5% conventional
- Must maintain Jenda's full-time status for mortgage qualification

### Blueprint: W4C Directory Revenue

**Definition:**
Rebuild Websites4Contractors.com on Brilliant Directories platform. Generate passive income through AdSense, premium listings, and Founding Member upsells via organic SEO.

**Why This Matters:**
W4C has a 25-year domain with proven earning history ($1,500/month AdSense at peak). Starting first allows SEO to build passively while CNA Packet is developed. Low maintenance once live.

**Target Date:** 01-31-2026 (Go-Live) / 07-2026 (Meaningful Traffic)

**The Completed Vision (Target Slide):**
W4C is live, indexing on Google, and generating $500+/month in combined revenue (AdSense + listings). SEO agencies are sending contractor clients for premium listings. Founding Members have upgraded to bulk packages. The site runs passively with 1-2 hours/week maintenance.

**Current State (01-31-2026):**
- **~65% complete** overall (BD core ~70%, Stripe ~60%, other areas not started)
- All 4 membership plans configured and tested
- 145 categories imported (19 trades + 126 services)
- Test listing created and verified (dofollow working)
- Stripe account reclaimed, rebranded, identity verification pending photo ID
- Key discovery: Square NOT supported by BD — pivoted to Stripe

- Domain not yet connected

**Tier Structure (Finalized 01-22-2026):**

| Tier | Monthly | Annual | What's Included |

| Pro | $15/mo | $149/yr | Full listing, dofollow backlink, photos, contact form |
| Featured | $29/mo | $279/yr | Pro + homepage rotation, badge, priority search, blog spotlight |

**Founding Member Plan (Hidden):**
- Cloned from Pro with identical features
- Hidden from public signup (admin-only assignment)
- For existing 10 clients at grandfathered rates

**Public Bulk Pricing:**

| Listings | Pro Annual | Featured Annual |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 5+ | $129/each | $249/each |
| 10+ | $99/each | $199/each |

**Founding Member Bulk Pricing (Exclusive):**

| Additional Listings | Pro Annual | Featured Annual |

| 1-4 | $99/each | $199/each |

### Blueprint: CNA Packet Revenue

**Definition:**
Launch CNAPacket.com as a subscription product for California SNFs who need compliant CNA program documentation. The interactive workflow app guides users through building and exporting a submission-ready packet.

**Why This Matters:**
CNA Packet is the only path that can close the full $3,450/month gap. Automated acquisition (cold email) minimizes direct client interaction. Passive subscription model aligns with lifestyle goals.

**Target Date:** 03-15-2026 (First Revenue) / 09-2026 (Scale toward target)

**Current Status:**
Website 92% complete. App development not started. Sequencing decision made: Build W4C first (let SEO clock start), then begin CNA Packet development.

**Next Action:**
Begin app development after W4C goes live (~02-01-2026).

**Revenue Target:** 71 members × $49/month = $3,479/month

## Health Pillar

### Blueprint: Eye Surgery & Recovery

**Definition:**
Correct vision issues through cataract surgery. Expected to significantly improve quality of life.

**Why This Matters:**
Clear vision impacts everything — work, driving, daily function.

**Target Date:** 02-17-2026

**Construction Stages:**

**Stage 1: Consultation** — Target: 01-28-2026 ✓
- [x] Attend eye surgeon consultation (01-28-2026)
- [x] Understand recommended procedure: Cataract surgery
- [x] Schedule surgery date: 02-17-2026

**Stage 2: Pre-Surgery Preparation** — Target: 02-16-2026
- [x] Pick up eye drops prescription (01-30-2026)
- [ ] Follow any pre-op instructions from surgeon
- [ ] Confirm Jenda can drive (surgery center requires escort home)
- [ ] Plan lighter construction schedule for recovery week

**Stage 3: Surgery & Recovery** — Target: 02-17-2026 to 02-24-2026
- [ ] Complete cataract surgery (02-17-2026, 10:00 AM)
- [ ] Follow post-op care instructions
- [ ] Reduced screen time for 3-5 days post-surgery
- [ ] Foundation work only — no deep construction
- [ ] Follow-up appointment (TBD)

**Current Status:**
Consultation complete. Surgery scheduled for 02-17-2026 at 10:00 AM at Glenwood Surgery Center (8945 Magnolia Ave, Suite 200, Riverside, CA 92503). Eye drops prescription picked up 01-30-2026.

**Next Action:**
Prepare for surgery. Plan recovery week with reduced expectations.

**Structural Challenges:**
- Recovery will require temporary shift to maintenance-only mode
- Reduced screen time for 3-5 days — limit deep work
- Jenda must accompany (no Uber/taxi allowed per surgery center policy)

---

### Blueprint: Prostate Monitoring

**Definition:**
Address prostate concerns with new urologist. Rule out or address any cancer concerns.

**Why This Matters:**
Health uncertainty creates mental drag on all construction. Clarity enables focus.

**Target Date:** TBD (after consultation)

**Construction Stages:**

**Stage 1: Consultation** — Target: 03-10-2026
- [ ] Attend urologist consultation (03-10-2026)
- [ ] Complete any recommended tests
- [ ] Understand diagnosis and path forward

**Stage 2: Treatment (if needed)** — Target: TBD
- [ ] Follow recommended treatment plan
- [ ] Adjust daily expectations during any treatment/recovery

**Current Status:**
Consultation scheduled for 03-10-2026. ProstateProtocol app concept evaluated — build for personal use, potential commercialization later.

**Next Action:**
Attend consultation on 03-10-2026. Continue prostate health stack (Pumpkin Seed Oil, Vitality Nexus Elixir, fasting).

**Structural Challenges:**
- Uncertainty until diagnosis is known
- Possible treatment could impact construction capacity

---

### Blueprint: Mom's Health Monitoring

**Definition:**
Support Mom's health appointments and care as she lives with Rob and Jenda.

**Why This Matters:**
Mom is 84 and part of the household. Her health supports the family foundation and she will co-sign the mortgage.

**Completed:**
- [x] Neurologist appointment: 01-26-2026 (10:30 AM) ✓

---

## Love Pillar

### Blueprint: Jenda's Debt Reduction & Credit Improvement

**Definition:**
Eliminate Jenda's $7,500 credit card debt and improve her credit score to strengthen mortgage qualification.

**Why This Matters:**
Jenda is the primary mortgage applicant. Her credit score directly impacts loan approval and interest rates. This also reduces monthly debt payments and stress.

**Target Date:** 04-30-2026

**Construction Stages:**

**Stage 1: 401K Loan Execution** — Target: 02-28-2026
- [ ] Jenda contacts Soboba HR about 401K loan process
- [ ] Complete 401K loan paperwork
- [ ] Receive loan funds
- [ ] Pay off credit card in full

**Stage 2: Credit Score Recovery** — Target: 04-30-2026
- [ ] Monitor credit score improvement (expect 30-50 point jump)
- [ ] Maintain zero balance on credit card
- [ ] Avoid new debt

**Current Status:**
Planning phase. Strategy decided (401K loan, not withdrawal). Need to initiate process with HR.

**Next Action:**
Jenda to contact Soboba HR about 401K loan process this week.

**Structural Challenges:**
- Must maintain full-time status to keep 401K loan terms
- Loan repayment comes from paycheck (~$200/month)

## Personal Projects

### Blueprint: AspirationArchitect

**Definition:**
Complete and launch AspirationArchitect.pro — a web app for goal achievement alignment and life journaling, built on React/Firebase.

**Why This Matters:**
This tool supports Rob's own construction process and could help others. It's also a demonstration of technical capability.

**Target Date:** TBD (after income stable)

**Current Status:**
Approximately 70-75% complete. Firestore save bug blocking progress. AI Coach module spec created 01-18-2026.

**Decision (01-21-2026):** This is personal infrastructure, not revenue. Fix gaps as maintenance. Don't prioritize over income-generating work. Keep AI Coach in Claude — await Claude Coworker for Windows.

**Next Action:**
Continue development when time permits. Freedom Pillar revenue work takes priority.

**Gaps Identified:**
- Firestore save bug (blocking)
- Goals/tasks UX needs improvement

## Long-Term Blueprints (Post March 2027)

### ARYVO (3-5 Year Timeline)

**Concept:** Personal thought-capture and insight engine with eventual social matching based on thought patterns.

**Status:** Concept only. Brand foundation locked (name, domain, tagline, visual identity).

**Why Later:** Social products require critical mass. Layer 3 (matchmaking) drives subscription value but needs years of user data.

---

### ProstateProtocol (After Income Stable)

**Concept:** App for prostate health management — sleep, autophagy, diet optimization.

**Status:** Concept only. Market research confirms opportunity (only 20 prostate apps exist out of 300,000 medical apps).

**Why Later:** Build for personal use now (proof of concept). Commercialize after March 2027.

---

### TattooMosaic (After W4C Stable)

**Concept:** Tattoo artist directory using Brilliant Directories (second slot on lifetime deal).

**Status:** Concept only. Competition exists but market is large ($16B industry).

**Why Later:** Zero domain authority. Same model as W4C — copy-paste execution once W4C proves concept.

---

### TransformingLocal (Opportunistic)

**Concept:** AI phone agents and Google Review automation for local service providers.

**Status:** Concept only.

**Why Later:** Service-heavy model conflicts with preference for minimal direct client interaction. Test with existing clients when time permits.
