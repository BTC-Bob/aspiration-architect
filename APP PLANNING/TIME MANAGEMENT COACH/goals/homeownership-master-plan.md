# Homeownership Master Plan

**Last Updated:** 01-18-2026  
**Target Move-In:** March 2027  
**Target Event:** Ajie's arrival from Philippines (April/May 2027)

---

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the path to purchasing a new mobile home on owned land (~$260,000) near San Jacinto, CA within 14 months. The strategy prioritizes mortgage qualification stability by keeping Jenda in her full-time position until after closing, while aggressively paying down debt, improving credit, and building savings.

---

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Jenda stays full-time Entry Screener until after move-in | Protects mortgage qualification; avoids tip income verification issues |
| Jenda takes 401K loan (not withdrawal) to pay off credit card | Saves ~$4,000+ in interest; immediate credit score boost; no tax penalty |
| Conservative estimates throughout | Buffer for unexpected setbacks |
| Mom co-signs mortgage | Adds income to qualification; she's willing |
| Jenda switches to Slot Attendant after move-in | Higher income long-term without jeopardizing mortgage |

## Risk Assessment & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| CNA Packet growth slower than projected | Medium | Medium | Conservative estimates built in; Jenda's income is primary qualifier |
| Jenda's credit score doesn't reach 680 | Low | High | FHA only requires 580; monitor monthly and address issues early |
| Mom unable to co-sign | Low | Medium | FHA may still work with Jenda alone if CNA Packet shows income |
| Property prices increase | Medium | Medium | Begin search early; consider slightly smaller/older property |
| Job loss (Jenda) | Low | Very High | Emergency fund priority; maintain good standing at Soboba |
| 401K loan complications | Low | Medium | Verify all terms with HR before proceeding |
| Ajie arrival delayed | Low | Low | Flexible timing; doesn't affect core plan |
| Interest rates increase | Medium | Medium | Lock rate early once pre-qualified |
