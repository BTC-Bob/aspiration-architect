#deck:AI & Digital Business Vocabulary
SaaS (Software as a Service)	Software delivered over the internet on a subscription basis. You pay monthly/annually rather than buying a license. Examples: Salesforce, Slack, Skool. The dominant business model in tech.	tier1::business-model
ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)	The annualized value of recurring subscription revenue. The holy grail metric for SaaS. A company with 1,000 customers paying $100/month has $1.2M ARR. MRR × 12 = ARR.	tier1::business-model
MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)	The total predictable revenue you earn each month from subscriptions. If you have 20 members at $49/month, your MRR is $980. MRR × 12 = ARR.	tier1::business-model
Churn Rate	The percentage of customers who cancel their subscription in a given period. Even 5% monthly churn means you lose half your customers in a year. The silent killer of SaaS businesses.	tier1::business-model
LTV (Lifetime Value)	The total revenue a customer generates over their entire relationship with you. If a customer pays $49/month and stays 18 months on average, LTV = $882. You want LTV to be at least 3× your CAC.	tier1::business-model
CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)	How much it costs to acquire one new paying customer, including all marketing, sales, and onboarding expenses. LTV/CAC ratio should be 3:1 or better for a healthy business.	tier1::business-model
PLG (Product-Led Growth)	A growth strategy where the product itself drives acquisition, conversion, and expansion. Users sign up, try it, and upgrade without talking to salespeople. Slack, Notion, Figma, and Skool all use PLG.	tier1::business-model
Self-Serve	A model where customers can sign up, configure, and start using the product without any human intervention. Critical for PLG and bootstrapped businesses.	tier1::business-model
Freemium	Offering a free tier to attract users, then converting some to paid plans. The free tier must be useful enough to hook people but limited enough to drive upgrades.	tier1::business-model
Tiered Pricing	Multiple pricing levels with increasing features. Free → Founders Edition → Enterprise. The most common SaaS pricing model. CNA Packet uses this with $49/month founding member pricing.	tier1::business-model
Usage-Based Pricing	Charging based on how much a customer uses rather than a flat subscription. AI APIs charge per token, AWS charges per compute hour. Revenue scales with usage but is less predictable.	tier1::business-model
Onboarding	The process of guiding new users from signup to their first meaningful success with your product. Bad onboarding kills even great products. The goal is to get users to the "aha moment" fast.	tier1::business-model
Activation	The moment a new user first experiences the core value of your product. For CNA Packet, activation might be completing their first template. Getting users to activation quickly is critical for retention.	tier1::business-model
Retention	The percentage of users who continue using your product over time. More important than acquisition. A "leaky bucket" means poor retention — you're acquiring users but they keep leaving.	tier1::business-model
Funnel	The stages users pass through from awareness to purchase. TOFU (Top of Funnel), MOFU (Middle of Funnel), BOFU (Bottom of Funnel). Analyzing where users drop off reveals optimization opportunities.	tier1::business-model
Conversion Rate	The percentage of users who take a desired action — free to paid, visitor to signup, lead to customer. A key metric at every stage of the funnel.	tier1::business-model
MVP (Minimum Viable Product)	The simplest version of a product that tests your core hypothesis with real users. Not polished — just enough to learn whether your idea works. Ship fast, learn fast.	tier1::business-model
PMF (Product-Market Fit)	The point where your product satisfies strong market demand. You know you have PMF when customers are genuinely upset at the thought of losing your product. Everything before PMF is searching; everything after is scaling.	tier1::business-model
ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)	A detailed description of the type of company or person most likely to buy and benefit from your product. For CNA Packet: SNF administrators and DONs in California looking to launch in-house CNA training programs.	tier1::business-model
Persona	A fictional representation of your ideal user, including demographics, goals, pain points, and behaviors. Helps focus all marketing and product decisions around a real human archetype.	tier1::business-model
Bootstrapped	Building a company without external investment, funded entirely by revenue and/or the founders' own money. You maintain 100% ownership but grow slower. Mailchimp was bootstrapped to a $12B acquisition.	tier1::business-model
Burn Rate	How much cash a startup spends per month beyond what it earns. A bootstrapped solopreneur's burn rate might be hosting costs + tools + subscriptions. Keep it low until revenue covers it.	tier1::business-model
Runway	How many months a company can operate before running out of cash. Runway = cash ÷ burn rate. Critical for planning when you need to hit revenue targets.	tier1::business-model
Land and Expand	A strategy where you get a small initial sale, then grow the account over time. For CNA Packet: start with one facility at $49/month, then they upgrade or refer other facilities.	tier1::business-model
Content Marketing	Creating valuable content to attract and engage potential customers. Blog posts, guides, templates, videos. The core of inbound marketing — pull people to you rather than pushing ads at them.	tier1::business-model
A/B Testing	Showing different versions of something to different users and measuring which performs better. Test email subject lines, landing page headlines, pricing. The gold standard for data-driven decisions.	tier1::business-model
Lead Generation (Lead Gen)	The process of identifying and attracting potential customers. Methods include content marketing, email outreach, web scraping (Hexomatic), social media, ads, and referrals.	tier1::business-model
Vibe Coding	Writing software by describing what you want to an AI and accepting its output with minimal deep review. Coined by Andrej Karpathy. Ranges from quick prototyping to full app development using tools like Cursor or Claude Code.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Prompt Engineering	The practice of crafting effective inputs to get better outputs from AI models. Includes techniques like few-shot examples, chain-of-thought, system prompts, and structured instructions. A real skill with measurable impact.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Context Window	The maximum amount of text/data an AI model can process at once, measured in tokens. Claude has up to 200K tokens. Think of it as the model's working memory — everything it can "see" during a conversation.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Tokens	The basic units that LLMs process text in. Roughly ¾ of a word in English. "Unhappiness" might be three tokens. Token counts determine API costs and context window limits.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
System Prompt	Hidden instructions given to a model before the user's message that define its behavior, personality, and constraints. When you create an AI agent or persona (like "Alex"), you're writing a system prompt.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
AI Agent (Agentic AI)	An AI system that can autonomously plan and execute multi-step tasks, use tools, make decisions, and adapt based on results. Unlike a chatbot that responds once, an agent might search, write code, run it, check results, and iterate.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Tool Use (Function Calling)	The ability for an AI model to invoke external tools — APIs, databases, calculators, code interpreters — as part of generating its response. How Claude searches the web, writes files, and interacts with services.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
MCP (Model Context Protocol)	Anthropic's open standard for connecting AI models to external tools and data sources. Think of it like USB for AI — a universal way to plug tools into any AI system. Rapidly gaining industry adoption.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Orchestration	Coordinating multiple AI models, tools, or agents to complete complex tasks. An orchestrator might route a question to a specialist, use the output to call an API, then synthesize the result.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Chain	A sequence of AI operations where the output of one step feeds into the next. "Retrieve documents → summarize → extract key facts → generate report." Made popular by frameworks like LangChain.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)	A technique where an AI retrieves relevant information from an external knowledge base before generating its response. Instead of relying solely on training data, the model "looks things up." Powers most enterprise AI products.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Agent OS	A spec-driven AI development framework using a three-layer context system (Standards → Product → Specs) with four main commands: plan-product, create-spec, execute-tasks, analyze-product. Simpler and more efficient than BMAD.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Spec-Driven Development	A methodology where detailed specifications are written before coding begins, giving AI agents the full context they need to produce correct code on the first attempt. "Frontload the thinking to avoid rewrites."	tier1-5::dev-workflow
IDE (Integrated Development Environment)	The software application where you write code. VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf are popular IDEs. Modern AI-powered IDEs like Cursor have AI deeply integrated into the editing experience.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
CLI (Command Line Interface)	A text-based interface for interacting with software by typing commands. Claude Code CLI runs in your terminal. Preferred by developers who want speed and scripting capability over visual interfaces.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Git	The industry-standard version control system that tracks changes to code over time. Lets you save snapshots (commits), create parallel versions (branches), and merge changes. Essential for any development project.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Repository (Repo)	A project's complete codebase and history stored in Git. Can be local (on your machine) or remote (GitHub, GitLab). "Clone the repo" means download a copy of the project.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Commit	A saved snapshot of your code at a specific point in time. Each commit has a message describing what changed. Like a save point in a video game — you can always go back to it.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Branch	A parallel version of your code where you can make changes without affecting the main codebase. "Create a branch for the new feature" means work on it separately, then merge it back when it's ready.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Merge	Combining changes from one branch into another. When your feature branch is ready, you merge it into the main branch. Conflicts occur when two branches changed the same code differently.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Pull Request (PR)	A request to merge your branch into the main codebase, typically with a code review step. In AI-assisted workflows, Claude Code can create and review PRs.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Refactoring	Restructuring existing code without changing its behavior. Improving readability, reducing duplication, simplifying complexity. Like rewriting a paragraph to say the same thing more clearly.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Debugging	The process of finding and fixing errors (bugs) in code. Involves reading error messages, adding logging, stepping through code execution, and testing hypotheses about what's wrong.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Technical Debt	The accumulated cost of quick-and-dirty solutions that need to be properly fixed later. Like financial debt, it compounds — small shortcuts today become major problems tomorrow.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Code Review	Examining someone's code changes before they're merged into the main codebase. Catches bugs, enforces standards, and shares knowledge. AI tools like Claude Code can assist with reviews.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)	Automated pipelines that test code when it's committed (CI) and deploy it to production automatically (CD). Catches bugs early and speeds up releases.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Deployment	The process of moving code from development to a live server where users can access it. Can be manual (FTP upload) or automated (CI/CD pipeline). "Deploy to production" means make it live.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
Greenfield	Starting a project from scratch with no existing code or constraints. The opposite of "brownfield" — working with legacy systems. Greenfield projects are exciting but need careful planning.	tier1-5::dev-workflow
PWA (Progressive Web App)	A web application that uses modern browser features to deliver an app-like experience. Works offline, can be installed on home screen, sends push notifications. Easy Form Mail Pro is built as a PWA.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
Service Worker	A JavaScript file that runs in the background of a PWA, enabling offline functionality, caching, and push notifications. It intercepts network requests and can serve cached content when offline.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
Manifest (Web App Manifest)	A JSON file that tells the browser how a PWA should behave when installed — its name, icon, colors, display mode, and start URL. Required for PWA installability.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
DNS (Domain Name System)	The internet's phone book — translates human-readable domain names (cnapacket.com) into IP addresses that computers use. DNS records control where your domain points and how email is routed.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
SSL/TLS	The encryption protocol that secures web traffic (the "S" in HTTPS). SSL certificates encrypt data between the user's browser and your server. Required for PWAs, SEO, and user trust.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)	The protocol used to send emails between servers. When configuring email for a web app, you need SMTP server settings (host, port, credentials). Many shared hosts block SMTP, requiring fallbacks.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
SPF (Sender Policy Framework)	A DNS record that specifies which mail servers are authorized to send email for your domain. Prevents spoofing and improves deliverability. Part of the email authentication trio: SPF, DKIM, DMARC.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)	An email authentication method that adds a digital signature to outgoing messages, proving they haven't been tampered with. Configured via DNS records. Essential for professional email delivery.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)	A DNS policy that tells receiving mail servers what to do when SPF or DKIM checks fail (none, quarantine, reject). Also provides reports on who is sending email using your domain.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
Shared Hosting	A web hosting model where multiple websites share the same server and its resources. Affordable but limited — may block SMTP, have restricted PHP settings, or throttle resources. Hostinger uses shared hosting.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
VPS (Virtual Private Server)	A virtualized server that gives you dedicated resources and root access. More control and power than shared hosting, but requires more technical management. The step up from shared hosting.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
CDN (Content Delivery Network)	A network of servers distributed globally that caches and serves your content from the location nearest to each user. Reduces latency and load on your main server. Hostinger includes basic CDN.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
.htaccess	An Apache web server configuration file that controls URL redirects, security rules, caching, password protection, and more. Lives in your website's directory. Powerful but syntax-sensitive.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
FTP/SFTP	File Transfer Protocol — used to upload/download files to/from a web server. SFTP is the encrypted version. Used for deploying code to shared hosting. PowerShell can handle FTP operations programmatically.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
Caching	Storing copies of data/files so they load faster on subsequent requests. Browser caching stores assets locally; server caching stores processed results. Configured via .htaccess or CDN settings.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
Latency	The time delay between a request and the response. Lower latency = faster experience. Affected by server distance, processing time, and network conditions. CDNs reduce latency.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
API (Application Programming Interface)	The interface through which software systems communicate. When your app calls Claude, it's using Anthropic's API. RESTful APIs use HTTP requests and return JSON data.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
Endpoint	A specific URL where you send API requests. Each capability (text generation, embeddings, search) typically has its own endpoint. Example: api.anthropic.com/v1/messages	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
Webhook	A way for one system to send real-time data to another when an event occurs. "When a new form submission comes in, POST the data to this URL." Essential for connecting services together.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
REST (Representational State Transfer)	The most common API architecture style. Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and returns JSON. Almost all modern web APIs, including AI APIs, are RESTful.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)	A lightweight data format used for transmitting structured data between systems. Looks like: {"name": "Rob", "role": "developer"}. The universal language of APIs.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
UTF-8 / Character Encoding	The standard for representing text as bytes. UTF-8 supports all languages and special characters. Encoding mismatches cause garbled text (mojibake) — a common deployment issue on shared hosting.	tier1-5::web-infrastructure
Backlog	The prioritized list of features, fixes, and improvements waiting to be worked on. Items move from backlog → in progress → done. Managed in tools like Trello, Jira, or a simple spreadsheet.	tier1-5::product-ops
User Story	A description of a feature from the user's perspective. Format: "As a [type of user], I want [action] so that [benefit]." Used to define work items in the backlog. Keeps development focused on user value.	tier1-5::product-ops
Sprint	A fixed time period (usually 1-2 weeks) during which a defined set of work is completed. At the end, you review what was built and plan the next sprint. Part of Agile methodology.	tier1-5::product-ops
Iteration	A cycle of building, testing, and improving. "We'll iterate on the landing page based on conversion data." Similar to sprint but more informal — just the idea of repeated refinement.	tier1-5::product-ops
Dogfooding	Using your own product before launching to customers. "Eating your own dog food." Helps catch bugs, build empathy for users, and understand the real experience. Testing Easy Form Mail Pro yourself is dogfooding.	tier1-5::product-ops
Shipping	Releasing features or products to users. "We shipped the new installer." "Ship it" culture emphasizes launching and learning over endlessly perfecting.	tier1-5::product-ops
Feature Flag	A toggle that lets you turn features on or off without deploying new code. Enables gradual rollouts, A/B testing, and instant rollbacks if something breaks.	tier1-5::product-ops
Staging vs. Production	Staging is a test environment that mirrors production (the live site). You deploy to staging first to catch issues before they reach real users. Your acewebhub.com/dev2/ directory is essentially staging.	tier1-5::product-ops
Rollback	Reverting to a previous working version when a new deployment causes problems. "The update broke the installer, let's rollback." Git makes rollbacks straightforward.	tier1-5::product-ops
SLA (Service Level Agreement)	A commitment to respond to or resolve issues within a defined timeframe. CNA Packet's support SLA is 2 business days. Setting and meeting SLAs builds trust.	tier1-5::product-ops
Email Deliverability	The ability of your emails to actually reach recipients' inboxes rather than spam folders. Affected by sender reputation, authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), content quality, and sending patterns.	tier1-5::email-outreach
Sender Reputation	A score assigned to your domain/IP by email providers based on your sending history. High bounce rates, spam complaints, and poor authentication tank your reputation. Monitored via Google Postmaster Tools.	tier1-5::email-outreach
Email Warm-up	The process of gradually increasing email sending volume on a new domain to build sender reputation. Start with small batches to known good addresses, slowly scale up over weeks.	tier1-5::email-outreach
Bounce Rate (Email)	The percentage of sent emails that failed to deliver. Hard bounces (invalid addresses) hurt reputation more than soft bounces (full inbox, temporary issues). Keep below 2%.	tier1-5::email-outreach
Open Rate	The percentage of delivered emails that were opened. Average B2B is 20-25%. Subject line is the biggest factor. Tracked via invisible pixel, so not 100% accurate.	tier1-5::email-outreach
Click-Through Rate (CTR)	The percentage of email recipients who clicked a link in the email. Average B2B is 2-5%. Measures engagement beyond just opening.	tier1-5::email-outreach
Cold Outreach	Contacting potential customers who haven't heard of you before — via email, LinkedIn, SMS, or calls. Requires careful compliance with CAN-SPAM and TCPA regulations.	tier1-5::email-outreach
Drip Campaign	An automated sequence of emails sent over time based on triggers or schedules. "Day 1: Welcome email. Day 3: Value prop. Day 7: Case study. Day 14: Offer." Nurtures leads toward conversion.	tier1-5::email-outreach
Email Sequence	A planned series of emails sent to prospects or customers. Similar to drip campaign but often refers to the entire strategic series rather than just the automation.	tier1-5::email-outreach
CRM (Customer Relationship Management)	Software for tracking all interactions with leads and customers. Stores contact info, communication history, deal stages, and notes. Can be as simple as a spreadsheet or as complex as Salesforce.	tier1-5::email-outreach
Segmentation	Dividing your audience into groups based on shared characteristics (industry, behavior, engagement level) to send more relevant, targeted communications.	tier1-5::email-outreach
Skool	A community platform that combines discussion forums, course content (Classroom), and membership payments. Integrates with Stripe for recurring billing. Used for CNA Packet's subscription community.	tier1-5::platform-community
Stripe	The dominant online payment processing platform for internet businesses. Handles subscriptions, one-time payments, invoicing, and payouts. Integrates with Skool, websites, and apps.	tier1-5::platform-community
Payment Gateway	The service that processes credit card transactions between your customer and your bank. Stripe, PayPal, Square. Handles authorization, fraud detection, and fund transfer.	tier1-5::platform-community
Recurring Billing	Automatically charging customers at regular intervals (monthly, annually). Managed through Stripe or similar platforms. The backbone of subscription businesses.	tier1-5::platform-community
Community Platform	Software that hosts online communities — discussion forums, member directories, events, and content libraries. Skool, Circle, Mighty Networks, Discord. The modern alternative to Facebook Groups.	tier1-5::platform-community
Onboarding Flow	The guided sequence a new member experiences after signup. For CNA Packet: welcome message → orientation video → first template → office hours invitation. Well-designed flows increase activation and retention.	tier1-5::platform-community
Content Drip	Releasing content to members on a schedule rather than all at once. Week 1: Module 1. Week 2: Module 2. Prevents overwhelm, maintains engagement, and reduces churn by giving ongoing value.	tier1-5::platform-community
Gated Content	Content that requires some action to access — signing up, paying, or completing a prerequisite. CNA Packet's templates are gated behind the $49/month subscription.	tier1-5::platform-community
Membership Site	A website or platform where users pay for ongoing access to content, community, and resources. CNA Packet on Skool is a membership site.	tier1-5::platform-community
SEO (Search Engine Optimization)	Optimizing content and websites to rank higher in search engine results. Includes on-page (content, meta tags, structure), off-page (backlinks, citations), and technical (speed, mobile, crawlability) optimization.	tier2::client-facing
AI Overview Optimization (AIO)	Optimizing content to appear in Google's AI-generated answer boxes at the top of search results. The cutting edge of SEO — being the source AI cites when synthesizing answers. A competitive advantage most agencies don't offer yet.	tier2::client-facing
GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)	The broader practice of optimizing content for all AI-powered search systems — Google AI Overviews, Bing Chat, Perplexity, ChatGPT search. The evolution of traditional SEO for the AI era.	tier2::client-facing
Moat	A sustainable competitive advantage that protects a business from competitors. Types: network effects, switching costs, brand, data advantage, regulatory expertise. CNA Packet's moat is deep compliance domain expertise.	tier2::client-facing
Flywheel	A self-reinforcing growth cycle where each element feeds the next. CNA Packet's flywheel: great templates → successful approvals → testimonials → more members → more feedback → better templates.	tier2::client-facing
Network Effects	When a product becomes more valuable as more people use it. Social networks are the classic example. CNA Packet's community gains network effects as more members share experiences and solutions.	tier2::client-facing
Wrapper	A product that's essentially a UI on top of someone else's API. Sometimes used dismissively ("just a GPT wrapper"), but many successful products add real value through UX, integrations, or domain expertise.	tier2::client-facing
AI-Native	A product built from the ground up around AI capabilities, rather than a traditional product with AI bolted on. Cursor is AI-native. Adding a chatbot to an old website is not.	tier2::client-facing
Copilot	An AI assistant that works alongside a human, suggesting and helping but not executing autonomously. GitHub Copilot for code, Microsoft 365 Copilot for office work. The human stays in command.	tier2::client-facing
Inference	Running a trained model to get outputs. Every time you send a message to Claude, that's inference. Inference costs are a major business concern for AI companies serving millions of users.	tier2::client-facing
Hallucination	When AI confidently generates false or fabricated information — citing nonexistent sources, inventing "facts." A fundamental challenge because models are pattern matchers, not truth engines.	tier2::client-facing
Fine-Tuning	Taking a pre-trained model and training it further on a specific, smaller dataset to specialize it. Like sending a generalist doctor to a specialty residency. Much cheaper than training from scratch.	tier2::client-facing
Open Source / Open Weights	Models where the trained weights are publicly available for download. Meta's Llama, Mistral. "Open weights" is more precise because training data and code aren't always shared.	tier2::client-facing
Transformer	The neural network architecture behind modern AI (the "T" in GPT). Key innovation: the "attention mechanism" lets the model weigh importance of different parts of input simultaneously. Introduced in Google's 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need."	tier3::deep-knowledge
LLM (Large Language Model)	A transformer-based AI trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate language. GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama. "Large" refers to billions to trillions of parameters.	tier3::deep-knowledge
Training	Teaching an AI model by showing it massive data and adjusting internal parameters. Training frontier models costs $100M+ and takes weeks on thousands of GPUs. Pre-training → post-training → fine-tuning.	tier3::deep-knowledge
Scaling Laws	The observed relationship that model performance improves predictably with more model size, data, and compute. This belief drives massive AI investment — "just keep making it bigger."	tier3::deep-knowledge
Alignment	Ensuring AI systems reliably do what humans actually want, especially as they become more capable. Ranges from "don't be annoying" to existential safety. Anthropic was founded specifically for alignment research.	tier3::deep-knowledge
GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)	The hardware that runs AI. Their parallel processing capability is ideal for neural network math. NVIDIA's H100 chips are the gold standard. Access to GPUs is a major competitive advantage.	tier3::deep-knowledge
Compute	Processing power, usually GPU time measured in FLOPS. "We need more compute" is the AI industry's constant refrain. Training GPT-4 required ~10²⁵ FLOPS.	tier3::deep-knowledge
Diffusion Model	The architecture behind image generators (Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E 3). Learns to gradually remove noise from random static until a coherent image emerges. Like sculpting from marble.	tier3::deep-knowledge
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)	An efficient fine-tuning technique that adds small trainable layers to a frozen model instead of updating all parameters. Dramatically reduces compute and memory needed for customization.	tier3::deep-knowledge
Quantization	Compressing model weights from high-precision (32-bit) to lower precision (8-bit, 4-bit). Makes models smaller and faster with minimal quality loss. Enables running models on consumer hardware.	tier3::deep-knowledge
AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)	Hypothetical AI with human-level abilities across all domains. No agreed-upon definition, which makes claims of "achieving AGI" squishy. Always "just around the corner."	tier3::deep-knowledge
e/acc (Effective Accelerationism)	A philosophy advocating maximum-speed AI development with minimal regulation. Believes tech progress is inherently good and slowing down is the real danger. Prominent voices: Marc Andreessen, Garry Tan.	tier3::deep-knowledge
Doomer	Someone who believes advanced AI poses serious existential risk to humanity. Ranges from cautious concern to certainty of doom. Prominent voices: Eliezer Yudkowsky, Geoffrey Hinton.	tier3::deep-knowledge
P(doom)	An individual's estimated probability that AI causes catastrophic outcomes for humanity. Ranges from less than 1% (optimists) to over 50% (doomers). Common icebreaker at AI conferences.	tier3::deep-knowledge
RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)	A training technique where humans rate AI outputs and those ratings train a reward model that guides the AI. Key to making models helpful and safe rather than just good at predicting text.	tier3::deep-knowledge
Embeddings	Numerical representations of words, sentences, or concepts as vectors in high-dimensional space. Similar concepts end up close together. "King" and "Queen" would be near each other. Foundation of semantic search.	tier3::deep-knowledge
Vector Database	A specialized database for storing and searching embeddings. Used in RAG systems to find relevant documents by meaning rather than keywords. Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma are popular options.	tier3::deep-knowledge
Mixture of Experts (MoE)	An architecture where multiple specialized sub-networks exist in one model, but only a few activate per input. Model can be huge in total but efficient because it only uses a fraction at a time.	tier3::deep-knowledge
Slop	Low-quality AI-generated content flooding the internet. Auto-generated articles, AI art used carelessly, spam. The volume problem created by making content generation nearly free.	tier3::deep-knowledge
GTM (Go-To-Market)	Your strategy for reaching and acquiring customers. Includes pricing, positioning, channels, sales approach, and distribution. CNA Packet's GTM includes email outreach, Skool community, and landing page conversion.	tier1::business-model
TAM (Total Addressable Market)	The total revenue opportunity if you captured 100% of your market. For CNA Packet: every SNF in California that could launch a CNA program, then nationally. Helps investors and you understand the opportunity size.	tier1::business-model
NRR (Net Revenue Retention)	Revenue from existing customers including expansions, contractions, and churn. NRR over 100% means existing customers spend more over time even after cancellations. The best SaaS metric for long-term health.	tier3::deep-knowledge
ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)	Total revenue divided by number of users. Tracks monetization efficiency. If you have 30 CNA Packet members generating $1,470 MRR, your ARPU is $49.	tier1::business-model
Paywall	The barrier between free and paid content or features. "Hit the paywall" means encountering a limitation that requires payment to continue.	tier1::business-model
